# Link Extractor: Step 3

A basic page scraping server that returns all the hyper references and anchor texts of the given web page in JSON.

## Changes from the previous step

* Added a server script that uses the link extraction module written in the last step
* Server is accessible as a WEB API at `http://<hostname>[:<prt>]/api/<url>`
* Dependencies are moved to the `requirements.txt` file
* Needs port mapping to make the service accessible

## Try it out

```
$ docker image build -t linkextractor:step3 .
$ docker container run -it --rm -p 5000:5000 linkextractor:step3
```

Open http://localhost:5000/api/http://odu.edu/ in a web browser or cURL from another terminal.

```
$ curl -i http://localhost:5000/api/http://example.com/
```

Press `Ctrl + C` to terminate the service.
